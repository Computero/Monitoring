Nagios OWA
======
Monitoring an Outlook Web Access site with Nagios.

I was tasked at work to devise a way to make our Exchange OWA site be monitored by our [Nagios 3](http://www.nagios.org) servers. After several days and some hours of research, hoping that someone had already done it in hopes of making my life easier; I ended up with one script that does the work. Being new to scripting it was most confusing and I ended up taking on the task to introduce myself to it.

Remember to change the default stuff to your host information  (for example: an.ipa.ddr.ess)

The Nagios admins have posted their way to do it [here](http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Email-and-Groupware/Microsoft-Exchange/check_exchange_webmail-2Esh/details).

- Check out the official [Nagios Plugins project](https://github.com/nagios-plugins) section here on Git.
